# Data_Visualisation_Earthquake


Using the linked dataset below produce a series of visualisations demonstrating the use of Matplotlib.

You should produce at least one of the following: 

        Bar Graph.
        Pie Chart.
        Box Plot.
        Line Chart.
        Scatter Plot.

Once you have demonstrated use of the different plots you should look at the data and make some conclusions from the data set. Can you find any links?

Present your conclusion illustrated with appropriate visualisations.

Submit your completed notebook.
